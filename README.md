Problem Domain: Gym Management System


My problem domain will focus on a gym system. We live in an era where everyone is trying to lead a healthy lifestyle, 
this system will show all the available gym classes and the gym membership types that are covered by all those classes it 
will also give the users (members) seasonal diets that they could try at home. The members will have an option of taking a class 
with other individuals or take them with their assigned instructors alone. The system will be structured in such a way that it will 
be convenient to the user, instead of them having to log into the website each time they can actually manage their health from their 
finger tips
